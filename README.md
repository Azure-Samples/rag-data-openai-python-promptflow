## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**The following steps assume you want to create net new Azure AI resources, including a hub and project, and deploy this sample application as-is**. You can use `azd provision` to provision the required resources, then explore the code and test locally, and then use `azd deploy` to deploy the sample code to a managed endpoint in Azure AI Studio. If you don't want to test locally, you can use `azd up` which will provision the resources and then deploy all in one go.

**If instead, you already have Azure AI resources** (for example, you reached this sample from the Code tab in Azure AI Studio from within an existing AI project) **you should instead follow the README within the /src folder**. This will walk you through how to use the Azure AI SDKs to set existing resources and provision any additional necessary resources you don't have (for example an AI Search resource), and develop custom code, evaluate, and deploy your code.
